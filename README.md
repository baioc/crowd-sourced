# crowd-sourced

[Crowd Sourcd][Crowd Sourced] is a free platform that lets users from all around the world contribute to labelling textual and graphical data for the intention of data for machine learning and as a open source way of collecting human labelled, gold standard data for machine learning models.

This project comes with a basic UI support, an easy to use interface, set of ready to use interactions and most importantly, all of the content provided with ease for the user to label, so that you can have whatever data for labelling you like in the database without worrying about how the data will be served and labelled.

## Features

Your project will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:

- üéÅ **Modern** ‚Äì Project created using the latest features of React (State management using Hooks)

- üíª **Responsive** ‚Äì Highly responsive and reusable UI components, that change depending on the provided props, since the UI library used here will be Material UI, which provides responsive components out of the box already

- üöÄ **Fast** ‚Äì Buttery smooth experience thanks to the light weight implementation of best practices in ReactJS

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Maintenance** - The project is built with Docker Compose, following the easiness of adding and removing services, with easy to add code for maintainability purposes

### Installation

You‚Äôll need to have Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it‚Äôs not required on the server). I recommend using the latest LTS version.

To create a new app, you have to:

### npx

Use the following command 

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template adrinlol
cd my-app
npm start
```
